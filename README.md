# nws-unidata-awips-compat

This repository contains files that allow National Weather Service AWIPS thin clients (such as those downloaded from the [AWIPS Technical Library](https://vlab.ncep.noaa.gov/web/awips-technical-library/home)) to interoperate with [Unidata AWIPS](http://unidata.github.io/awips2/) EDEX servers. These files have been primarily tested on CAVE clients connecting to [AllisonHouse's](https://www.allisonhouse.com) EDEX offering, but should work with any Unidata AWIPS server.

The repository also holds some files that, for some reason, haven't made it into the AWIPS baseline yet that many will find useful (such as those that enable GOES-R-series RGB products).

## Why?

The Unidata CAVE client is primarily geared toward educational and research settings. This is fantastic for those environments, but the official NWS clients are generally better suited for operational forecasting and situational awareness (in my view, at least).
