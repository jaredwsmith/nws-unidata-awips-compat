# NWS AWIPS menu fixes

The menu system in Unidata AWIPS vs. the NWS CAVE client has some key differences, particularly around models and how observations are displayed. Worse yet, some menus have been completely deleted in the Unidata build, so when firing up a NWS client, there are several error messages regarding menus every time.

This folder contains menu files that can be imported into your localization to squelch error messages and bring models back.
